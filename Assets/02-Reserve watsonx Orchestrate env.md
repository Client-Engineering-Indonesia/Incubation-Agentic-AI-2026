## Additional reservation (watsonx.ai))

### Reserve watsonx.ai for trainers

Use "watsonx.ai/.governance SaaS" as your main watsonx.ai environment. Once your watsonx.ai environment is ready you also must follow steps similar to what you have done with watsonx Orchestrate.

### Reserve watsonx.ai environment for participants

There is also a case where you must provide environment for the participants. For this case you use "watsonx.ai/.governance w/Student ID" in Techzone environment. Once it is ready, you will be receiving URL, username and password that can be used for the participants. The environment is optimal for 1 participant, so if you have 10 participants it is recommended to reserve 10 environments.
