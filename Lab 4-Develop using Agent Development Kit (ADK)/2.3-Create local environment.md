# Module 2.3: Create Local Environment

---

## Overview

In this module, you'll learn how to configure your local development environment to connect with remote watsonx Orchestrate instances. This involves obtaining credentials, adding remote environments, and activating them for use with the ADK CLI.

**Duration:** ~25 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand watsonx Orchestrate environments (local vs remote)
- Obtain API credentials from watsonx Orchestrate
- Add remote environments to ADK CLI
- Activate and authenticate against environments
- Manage multiple environments

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- ✅ Completed **Module 2.1: Creating Connection**
- ✅ Completed **Module 2.2: Install ADK**
- ✅ Access to watsonx Orchestrate instance (IBM Cloud or AWS)
- ✅ Admin or developer permissions
- ✅ ADK CLI installed and configured

---

## Understanding Environments

### What are Environments?

The watsonx Orchestrate ADK introduces **environments (env)**, which represent instances of watsonx Orchestrate you can access.

**Environments can be:**

1. **Local**: Running on your laptop using the Developer Edition of watsonx Orchestrate
2. **Remote**: Hosted on IBM Cloud, AWS, or on-premises using Cloud Pak for Data

### Environment Behavior

When you **activate an environment**, all commands (except `orchestrate server` and `orchestrate chat`) target that environment. This includes:
- Importing agents, tools, and connections
- Listing resources
- Removing resources
- Deploying agents

## Part 1: Getting Credentials for Your Environment

### Step 1: Access watsonx Orchestrate Settings

To connect to a remote environment, you need:
- **Service Instance URL**
- **API Key**

⚠️ **Important**: Don't use the credentials from the IBM Cloud resources page. Follow this procedure to get the appropriate credentials.

1. Log in to your **IBM Cloud**
2. Open **watsonx Orchestrate** instance from **Resource List** page
3. Save **API Key** and **Service Instance URL** from the page

## Part 2: Configure Access to Remote Environments

### Step 2: Add Remote Environment

Use the `orchestrate env add` command to add a remote environment to your local CLI.

**Syntax:**
```bash
orchestrate env add -n <environment-name> -u <your-instance-url>
```

**Example:**
```bash
orchestrate env add \
  -n workshop \
  -u https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com/ml/v1/instances/abc123-def456-ghi789
```

**Parameter Explanation:**
- `-n workshop`: Name for this environment (you choose this)
- `-u <url>`: Service instance URL you copied in Step 1

---

### Step 3: Activate Environment

Use the `orchestrate env activate` command to authenticate against the environment and target all commands to it.

**Syntax:**
```bash
orchestrate env activate <environment-name>
```

**Example:**
```bash
orchestrate env activate workshop
```

**Interactive Prompt:**
```
Please enter WXO API key: 
```

**Enter the API key** you generated in Step 1.

You will see your local enviornment has been activated.

```
[INFO] - Environment 'workshop' is now active
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've configured your local environment, you're ready to:

➡️ **[Module 2.4: Create Python Tool to Retrieve Dataset from PostgreSQL](2.4-Create%20python%20tool%20to%20retrieve%20dataset%20from%20PostgreSQL.md)**
- Build custom Python tools
- Connect to PostgreSQL database
- Import tools into watsonx Orchestrate
